# Information Architecture (IA) (Louis et al., 2015)
- A design discipline that is focused on making information findable and understandable. Because of this, it is uniquely well suited to address these challenges. IA allows us to think about problems through two important perspectives: that information products and services are perceived by people as places made of information, and that these information environments can be organized for optimum findability and understandability.
- Definitions:
    1. The structural design of shared information environments
    2. The synthesis of organization, labeling, search, and navigation systems within digital, physical, and cross-channel ecosystems
    3. The art and science of shaping information products and experiences to support usability, findability, and understanding

# Information Architecture Process Definition (Jaye, 2023)
- The process of guiding users through the site by organizing and arranging all the relevant content in a clear, intuitive way

# Information Architecture Comprehensive Definition (Wei, 2025)
- Information architecture is about organizing and simplifying information for its intended users
- Designing, integrating and aggregating information spaces to create usable systems or interfaces
- Creating ways for people to find, understand, exchange and manage information
- Therefore, stay on top of information and make right decisions

# IA Main Components (Jaye, 2023)
- Together, these components create an efficient navigation system so users can easily find what they need without getting lost or overwhelmed by too much information:
    1. Structure: Involves organizing content into categories, hierarchies, and relationships
    2. Labelling: Uses words to represent and classify these categories, hierarchies, and relationships

# Information Architecture Components (Louis et al., 2015)
- Information architecture components by breaking them up into the following four categories:
    1. Organization Systems: How we categorize information (e.g., by subject or chronology)
    2. Labeling Systems: How we represent informationâ€”for example, using scientific terminology ("Acer") or lay terminology ("maple")
    3. Navigation Systems: How we browse or move through information (e.g., clicking through a hierarchy)
    4. Searching Systems: How we search information (e.g., executing a search query against an index)

# Information Architecture Components (Wei, 2025)
- In general, to have good information architecture, one needs to consider the following components:
    1. Logical Organization: E.g., alphabetic, numerical, and hierarchical organization schemas as well as placement and labels
    2. Semantic Organization: E.g., metadata, controlled vocabularies, content indexing, and tagging
    3. Structural Navigation: E.g., global, local and contextual navigation, process/wizard navigation, and browsing aids
    4. Search: E.g., search algorithms, search result displays, search interfaces, AI agents, and other search aids

# Key concepts
## Structuring
- Involves determining the appropriate levels of granularity for the information "atoms" in your product or service
- Deciding how to relate them to one another
## Organizing
- Involves grouping those components into meaningful and distinctive categories
- Creating the right contexts for users to understand the environment they are in and what they're looking at
## Labeling
- Means figuring out what to call those categories and the navigation structure elements that lead to them
## Findability
- Findability is a critical success factor for overall usability
- If users can't find what they need through some combination of browsing, searching, and asking, then the system fails
