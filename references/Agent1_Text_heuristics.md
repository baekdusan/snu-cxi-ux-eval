# These are key terms and definition: 
- Text: A readable element composed of written language characters.
- Text legibility: the ease with which a reader can accurately perceive and encode text. (Slattery & Rayner, 2010) 

# Important design and evaluation heuristics of text legibility are as follows:
1. The width-to-height ratio of characters should be visually balanced — not too wide, nor too narrow — to ensure optimal legibility. (A ratio of approximately 0.7:1 to 0.9:1 is generally considered ideal for body text.)
2. Use a reasonably large default font size so it’s legible without zooming.
3. Use a clean typeface. With today’s high-resolution monitors, serif type is fine, but strangely shaped fonts (e.g., emulating handwriting or gothic style) have reduced legibility.
4. Make sure there is ample contrast between the font color and the background so text is legible.
5. Employ a plain background instead of a busy or textured one, since the latter interferes with the recognition of the fine details in the letterforms.
