# These are key terms and definition: 
- Depth refers to the number of levels in the hierarchy.
- Breadth refers to the number of options at each level of the hierarchy. 

# Important design and evaluation heuristics of information architecture (IA) structure are as follows:
1. Systematically categorize information items based on user tasks or conceptual similarity.
2. Clearly express hierarchical relationships—both visually and structurally—so users can intuitively understand how items are related.
3. Be aware of the principle of mutual exclusivity in hierarchical categories, but do not treat it as a strict rule.
4. Avoid overwhelming users with too many choices when they navigate the interface.
5. When designing for breadth, account for users’ visual scanning abilities and the cognitive limitations of the human mind.
6. When designing for depth, minimize the number of navigational steps required to access a specific information item.
    - The optimal depth is generally considered to be 2 to 3 levels.
7. Maintain a thoughtful balance between breadth and depth to avoid both excessive navigation and overwhelming menu options.
    - If a hierarchy is too narrow and deep, users have to click or tap through an inordinate number of levels to find what they are looking for. If a hierarchy is too broad and shallow, as in this case users are faced with too many options on the main menu and are unpleasantly surprised by the lack of content once they select an option.
