# Heuristic 1: Concreteness - This icon should depict real-world objects, materials, or people rather than abstract shapes.
One of the strongest claims made for symbols, and particularly for icons, is that they are easier to use because they are concrete. Concrete symbols tend to be more visually obvious because they depict objects, places, and people that we are already familiar with in the real world. There was no significant correlation between concreteness and visual complexity, suggesting that concrete symbols can also be simple.

# Heuristic 2: Simplicity - The icon should consist of only a few elements and is visually simple without excessive detail.
Design guidelines typically suggest that the design of symbols or icons should be kept as simple as possible. As far back as 1970, Easterby suggested that designers follow a "simplicity principle" because he felt that extra detail did not contribute to unambiguous and rapid interpretation of a symbol. This minimalist design approach has been endorsed by Rogers (1989). In a recent study, Byrne (1993) created a series of simple and complex symbols and examined the effect of symbol complexity on search performance. Search times were found to be shorter for simple, as opposed to complex symbols. Byrne's findings seem to support the proposition that simplicity is the best policy in symbol design, particularly if response time is an important consideration.

# Heuristic 3: Meaningfulness - The icon should seem meaningful to users and gives a clear idea of what it is about.
A critical determinant of a symbol's usability was the meaningfulness of the relationship between what was depicted in the symbol and the function it refers to. To assess meaningfulness, users should be able to quickly grasp what an icon represents. This can be measured by having users rate how meaningful a symbol appears to them, typically on a 5-point scale (e.g., 1 = completely meaningless, 5 = highly meaningful). In addition to ratings, users should be asked to describe what they think the symbol means. If users consistently infer the correct function (or closely related ones), the icon can be considered meaningful. Rather than focusing on exact label matching, concept agreement should be used—accepting synonyms, abbreviations, and variations in wording—as it better captures whether users understand the intended function. High concept agreement indicates the icon reliably conveys its intended meaning across different users. If users assign a meaning different from the designer’s intention but do so consistently, this may signal a more intuitive alternative function worth considering.

# Heuristic 4: Familiarity - The icon should be familiar because it resembles signs that people often encounter.
Familiarity reflects the frequency with which symbols are encountered. This property is thought to be an important determinant of usability. It is evident that user performance improves dramatically as a result of learning symbols and signs (see, e.g., Brems & Whitten,1987; Margono & Shneiderman, 1987).

# Heuristic 5: Semantic distance - The icon’s appearance should closely match the function or concept it is intended to represent.
Semantic distance is a measure of the closeness of the relationship between the symbol and what it is intended to represent. In some cases, the relationship is very clear (e.g., when a picture of a printer is used to denote the "print" function in a word processing package). In other cases, the relationship is less obvious (e.g., the triangle used to represent a "hazard ahead"). The "semantic distance" between function and symbol might be regarded as quite small in the first case, but much larger in the second case.
It is important to note that semantic distance may not necessarily be synonymous with a symbol’s meaningfulness. For example, in Figure C, the hazard sign may be meaningful to drivers because of their familiarity with it, even though the semantic distance between symbol and referent is large.
