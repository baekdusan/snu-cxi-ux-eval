1. Goal
- Definition: A goal is an intended outcome that a user seeks to achieve through interaction with a system, product, or service. It represents the user's purpose or end state, independent of the specific actions or methods used to accomplish it. Goals guide task selection and system usage, and serve as the anchor point for user-centered design and evaluation.
- Example: Successfully purchase a laptop that meets one’s needs.

2. Task
- Definition: A task is a set of physical, perceptual, and/or cognitive activities that a user performs in order to achieve a specific goal when interacting with a system or product. Unlike goals, which are outcome-oriented and independent of how they are achieved, tasks represent the particular means through which those goals are operationalized. Tasks are situated within a context of use and can span multiple steps, actions, or decisions depending on the system's complexity.
- Example: Selecting a laptop, configuring product options, and adding it to the cart in order to complete a purchase.
 
3. Task Scenario
- Definition: A task scenario is a goal-oriented narrative that describes a realistic situation in which a user attempts to accomplish a specific objective using a system or service. It provides the context of use, including the user's intent, environment, and constraints, and serves as the basis for usability testing or design validation.
- Example: “You want to purchase a laptop for work. Use the website to find a suitable product and complete the purchase process.”
- Key Features:
    - Anchored in the user’s goal and context of use
    - Used to initiate task performance during evaluation
    - Does not prescribe specific steps, but frames the intended task outcome
 
4. Screen
- Definition: A screen refers to a discrete visual interface state presented to the user within a digital system, such as a web or mobile application. It represents a functional unit within the system's navigation structure, typically associated with a specific set of information or operations.
- Example: Home screen, Product detail screen, Cart screen
- Key Features:
    - Unit of interaction in the navigation flow
    - Defined by distinct UI content and controls
    - Used in task flows to map out transitions between states
 
5. Task Flow
- Definition: A task flow is a structured sequence of screens or system states that a user navigates through in order to accomplish a defined goal. It reflects the user’s pathway through the system and captures how tasks are operationalized in the interface.
- Example: Home → Search → Product Detail → Cart → Checkout → Confirmation
- Key Features:
    - Composed of multiple screens linked by user/system transitions
    - Maps the procedural path toward a goal
    - Reflects the system-side implementation of a task scenario
 
6. Interaction Sequence
- Definition: An interaction sequence refers to the ordered set of user actions and system responses occurring within a single screen to complete a sub-task. It encompasses perceptual, cognitive, and physical interactions mediated through the user interface.
- Example: Typing a search keyword → Tapping the search button → Viewing the result list
- Key Features:
    - Occurs within a screen
    - Represents user-system interaction episodes
    - Reflects the fine-grained activity level of task execution
 
7. Navigational Interaction
- Definition: A navigational interaction is a user-initiated interaction that causes a transition from one screen to another within a digital system. It differs from other forms of interaction that involve content manipulation or intra-screen state changes, in that it defines the user's movement along the task flow and determines the structure of the user journey. Navigational interactions serve as functional transitions between discrete UI states.
- Example: Clicking a “View Details” button on the product list screen to move to the product detail screen.
- Key Features:
    - Triggers a transition between screens within a task flow
    - Represents a structural link in the navigation path
    - Often involves UI elements such as buttons, links, or tabs
    - Plays a central role in defining the progression of user tasks across screens
